The Shafdan, the largest wastewater treatment facility in Israel, would like to incorporate novel data analysis tools for its data. Everyday it measures the concentration of many different microorganisms in the wastewater, and it also has data which is a proxy of the quality of the water it purified. The goal is to develop a model that can correlate a specific concentration of one or more microorganisms which always results in better wastewater quality. This model can be based on either classical statistical methods or on more modern approaches.
